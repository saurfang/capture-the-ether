# capture-the-ether

Example code for my [Medium Let's Play Series](https://medium.com/@saurfang/lets-play-capture-the-ether-warmup-68a5fc38e670) for [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com).

## What is Capture the Ether?
In Capture the Ether, we win points by completing challenges. Each challenge comes with a smart contract to deploy and objectives can be completed by exploiting the contract into a specific state. Challenges are grouped into categories that focus on specific areas of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Why this Series?
I have learnt my Solidity skill first through CryptoZombies, and written some smart contracts with Truffle framework in a few hackathons. As of this writing, I am halfway through the Lottery section and have found it to be an engaging educational resource.

I have not yet had trouble coming up with ideas how to tackle the challenge, but I had plenty painful moments figuring out the tools I need to implement my approach and debugging my smart contract.

In this series of articles, I will focus on practical smart contract programming and my hard learnt mistakes. I will lay out the tools and IDE/CLI setup, explain the key security insight of each problem, and show you how to implement them in practice. It will assume you have basic understanding of how Ethereum works and I highly recommend you go through CryptoZombies first to learn the basics of Solidity. In the interests of space, I will not explain concepts in details but will provide links as necessary.
